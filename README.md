Subject: Programming 1

Members: Marcelo Nacimba, Erick Estrada.

Repository Description:
-Version of java 17
-Scanner Classes
-Math classes
-Functions
-Switch

Create a program that does the following.

     1)Read by keyboard 3 options such as A, B and C.
     2)When option A is detected we will do the following:
     2.1)Call a function or method that performs the sum of two integers,
     the method "has" to return the result of the sum.
     3)Op B
     3.1) Op B Call a function that receives a string and prints the string it receives, the function returns nothing.
     4)Op C 4.1 )Call a function that receives an integer and returns the cosine of that value.
     5)Call a print function to print the cosine result.
      

Which language uses the most libraries or third party packages?</p> 
The language that uses the most third-party libraries or packages is JavaScript, especially due to the vast amount of packages available on npm (Node Package Manager). This is due to the popularity of JavaScript in both frontend and backend development, driving an active community that constantly creates and maintains numerous packages for various functionalities.

- What was our motivation?
The motivation for this project was to implement what we have learnt in practice, as we see the basis of this intelliJ IDEA programme with Java code.


- Why was this project built?
This project was built in order to implement the new features, functions and methods given in the theory.

- What problem does it solve?
The following program solves a sum, of numbers, that returned the result, print a String function and as a last one that gives us an integer and gives us the cosine of that cosine and this same print.

- What was learned?
New methodologies, functions, cases, integer variables, variable, are characters.


- What stands out in your project?

My project stands out in the collaboration that we had at the time of realizing it this in order to do it in record time and also communicating with the collaborators.
